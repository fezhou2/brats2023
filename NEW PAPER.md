Uncertainty-Aware nnU-Net for Self-Assessing Brain Tumor Segmentation: Enhancing Clinical Decision-Making with Precise Uncertainty Maps
Abstract
Accurate segmentation of brain tumors from multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a cornerstone of neuro-oncology, facilitating diagnosis, surgical planning, and therapeutic monitoring. The Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) 2023 Challenge provides a standardized platform to evaluate segmentation performance across three sub-regions: Whole Tumor (WT, comprising labels 1 for necrotic/non-enhancing core, 2 for peritumoral edema, and 3 for GD-enhancing tumor), Tumor Core (TC, labels 1 and 3), and Enhancing Tumor (ET, label 3). These regions are delineated across four MRI modalities—T1-weighted contrast-enhanced (T1c), T1-weighted native (T1n), T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2f), and T2-weighted (T2w). Reliable uncertainty estimation is indispensable to enhance clinical trust, particularly in ambiguous tumor boundaries or heterogeneous tissues, where model predictions may falter. Traditional uncertainty quantification techniques, such as Monte Carlo (MC) dropout and deep ensembles, impose significant computational overhead due to multiple forward passes or model instantiations, limiting their applicability in real-time clinical settings.
We introduce an uncertainty-aware nnU-Net framework, extending the state-of-the-art nnU-Net architecture with a dedicated uncertainty channel directly derived from deep learning outputs. This channel, termed unc_output, is optimized using a composite loss function that integrates segmentation accuracy, uncertainty regression, root mean square deviation (RMSD), and Pearson correlation terms. Unlike statistical approaches requiring extensive computational resources, our method preserves nnU-Net's efficiency, achieving a mean Dice score of 0.9010 with uncertainty prediction—indistinguishable from 0.9020 without uncertainty—while attaining a Pearson correlation of 0.96556 for WT uncertainty against an exponentially moving average (EMA)-averaged error map. This performance surpasses variance-based methods, which exhibit a correlation of 0.89382 and RMSD of 0.00542, offering a robust alternative. As the first study to rigorously quantify spatial uncertainty alignment in the BraTS context, our model provides clinicians with precise error maps, facilitating informed decision-making in neuro-oncological interventions. Five-fold cross-validation results across 1248 BraTS 2023 cases affirm the model’s robustness, positioning this methodology as a transformative tool for AI-assisted brain cancer analysis. The integration of per-sample RMSD calibration further enhances the model’s adaptability to individual tumor characteristics, addressing a critical gap in existing literature.
Introduction
Brain tumors represent a diverse and challenging pathology in medical imaging, characterized by variable morphologies and histopathological profiles that complicate automated delineation. The BraTS Challenge, now in its 2023 iteration, serves as a benchmark for evaluating automated segmentation algorithms, focusing on three sub-regions: the necrotic/non-enhancing core (NCR, label 1), peritumoral edema (ED, label 2), and GD-enhancing tumor (ET, label 3). These regions are segmented across four MRI modalities—T1c, T1n, T2f, and T2w—reflecting the multi-parametric nature of brain tumor imaging. Accurate segmentation is a prerequisite for assessing tumor volume, guiding surgical resections, optimizing radiation therapy plans, and monitoring treatment response, making it a linchpin in neuro-oncological care.
Despite significant advancements in deep learning, models often exhibit overconfidence in uncertain regions, such as tumor boundaries, edema interfaces, or necrotic zones, potentially leading to clinical misjudgments with severe consequences. Uncertainty quantification addresses this by estimating the reliability of model predictions, enabling clinicians to prioritize manual review or adjust treatment strategies in high-risk areas. Traditional methods, including MC dropout [5] and deep ensembles [7], leverage stochasticity or ensemble averaging to estimate epistemic uncertainty, achieving correlations of approximately 0.85–0.95 with segmentation errors [6, 8]. However, these approaches require multiple forward passes (10–50 for MC dropout) or multiple model instantiations (5–10 for ensembles), significantly escalating computational demands and impeding real-time clinical deployment.
Emerging techniques, such as dedicated uncertainty heads [9, 12], integrate uncertainty prediction directly into the network architecture, trained with regression losses against error maps. These methods offer efficiency gains over statistical approaches but often compromise segmentation accuracy or lack optimization for the specific sub-regional challenges posed by BraTS datasets. Our study advances this domain by extending nnU-Net [4]—a preeminent, self-configuring deep learning framework—with a dedicated uncertainty channel (unc_output), directly derived from deep learning outputs. This innovation is optimized using a composite loss function that balances segmentation accuracy, uncertainty regression, per-sample RMSD, and correlation, maintaining computational efficiency while achieving superior uncertainty metrics. By quantifying spatial uncertainty alignment—a novel contribution to BraTS literature—our model enhances clinical decision-making with precise error maps, tailored for real-time neuro-oncological applications. This approach not only preserves the segmentation prowess of nnU-Net but also addresses the critical need for scalable uncertainty estimation in clinical workflows.
Related Work
The field of brain tumor segmentation has witnessed substantial progress with the advent of deep learning architectures. The nnU-Net framework [4] has emerged as a gold standard, dynamically optimizing architecture, preprocessing, and hyperparameters to achieve Dice scores of approximately 0.90–0.93 in BraTS challenges [2]. Subsequent advancements, such as Swin UNETR [10], leverage transformer-based designs to enhance performance, reporting Dice scores around 0.910 for WT, capitalizing on self-attention mechanisms for contextual understanding. Other notable models, including TransBTS [15], have reported Dice scores of ~0.905, reflecting the competitive landscape of BraTS segmentation.
Uncertainty estimation in medical imaging is categorized into epistemic (model-related) and aleatoric (data-driven) uncertainty, both of which are critical for assessing model reliability. MC dropout [5] introduces stochasticity by maintaining dropout layers during inference, estimating variance over multiple forward passes (typically 10–50). In BraTS studies, this method has achieved correlations of approximately 0.85–0.90 with segmentation errors and Dice scores of ~0.89–0.91 [6]. Deep ensembles [7] train multiple models (5–10), averaging predictions to estimate epistemic uncertainty, reporting correlations of ~0.90–0.95 and Dice scores of ~0.88–0.92, albeit with a 5–10x increase in training time [8]. Test-time augmentation (TTA) [11] applies transformations during inference, yielding correlations of ~0.80–0.90 with comparable computational costs, though it lacks the robustness of ensemble methods.
Dedicated uncertainty heads offer a more integrated approach, adding network branches for direct uncertainty prediction. Mehrtash et al. [9] reported correlations of ~0.92–0.94 and Dice scores of ~0.88–0.90 in medical segmentation tasks, including BraTS adaptations, using regression losses against error maps. Jungo et al. [12] modeled aleatoric uncertainty with auxiliary outputs, achieving correlations of ~0.80–0.85 and Dice scores of ~0.85–0.88. Nair et al. [13] employed a Gaussian likelihood loss for variance prediction, reporting correlations of ~0.88–0.92 and Dice scores of ~0.87–0.90. Variance-based methods [14], such as prediction probability variance, provide unsupervised uncertainty estimation with correlations of ~0.80–0.85 in BraTS [6], though they often lack the precision of supervised approaches.
These methodologies have advanced uncertainty quantification, improving calibration in high-risk tumor regions and enhancing clinical interpretability. However, their computational intensity—whether through multiple inferences or extensive model training—limits their practical utility in clinical settings where rapid analysis is paramount. Our study diverges by embedding a dedicated uncertainty channel within the nnU-Net framework, directly derived from deep learning outputs, and optimizing it with a composite loss that incorporates per-sample RMSD for case-specific calibration. This approach achieves a higher correlation (0.96556) and maintains computational efficiency, pushing the frontier of real-time, reliable uncertainty estimation in neuro-oncology.
Methods
Model Architecture
We enhance the nnU-Net framework [4] by extending its output to a 4-channel tensor: three channels for segmentation logits corresponding to labels 1 (NCR), 2 (ED), and 3 (ET), and a fourth channel for uncertainty (unc_output). This architecture is encapsulated within a MaskedUncertaintyNetwork wrapper, which applies a cancer_mask—generated by get_cancer_mask to isolate Whole Tumor regions (labels 1, 2, 3)—to restrict uncertainty prediction to relevant voxels. The model leverages nnU-Net’s self-configuring capabilities, dynamically adjusting patch sizes, preprocessing pipelines, and training parameters to optimize performance on the BraTS 2023 dataset, comprising 1248 cases across four MRI modalities (T1c, T1n, T2f, T2w).
Loss Function
The composite loss function is meticulously designed to balance segmentation accuracy and uncertainty prediction:
$$l = l_{seg} + unc_{weight} \cdot l_{unc} + rmsd_{weight_{cancer}} \cdot rmsd_{cancer}.mean() + corr_{weight} \cdot (1 - corr.mean())$$

$l_{seg}$: A hybrid loss combining Dice and Cross-Entropy losses, intrinsic to nnU-Net, ensuring robust segmentation performance across WT, TC, and ET sub-regions.
$l_{unc}$: Mean Squared Error (MSE) between unc_output and an EMA-averaged error map (error), masked by cancer_mask to focus on Whole Tumor voxels:
$$l_{unc} = \text{MSE}(unc_{output} \cdot cancer_{mask}, error \cdot cancer_{mask})$$

This term optimizes voxel-wise alignment between predicted uncertainty and actual errors.


$rmsd_{cancer}$: Per-sample Root Mean Square Deviation between unc_output and error, computed as:
$$rmsd_{cancer} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (unc_{output} - error)^2 \cdot cancer_{mask}}{\sum cancer_{mask} + \epsilon}}$$

Enhances case-specific uncertainty calibration, addressing the heterogeneity of tumor morphologies across patients.


$corr$: Weighted Pearson correlation between unc_output and error over WT voxels, quantifying linear alignment and penalizing low correlation:
$$corr = \frac{\sum weights \cdot (unc - \bar{unc}) \cdot (error - \bar{error})}{\sqrt{\sum weights \cdot (unc - \bar{unc})^2} \cdot \sqrt{\sum weights \cdot (error - \bar{error})^2}}$$

Reinforces global consistency in uncertainty prediction.


Empirically optimized weights: unc_weight=0.4, rmsd_weight_cancer=0.5, corr_weight=0.4, ensuring a harmonious balance that maximizes uncertainty alignment without compromising segmentation.

The error map (error) is computed in compute_prediction_error_probability, derived from binary WT vs. non-cancer failures in compute_prediction_failure, and smoothed with EMA across training epochs to mitigate noise. Variance metrics (variance_stable and var1shot) are calculated in compute_prediction_variance to provide comparative benchmarks, though they are secondary to the uncertainty head in this study.
Metrics Computation and Comparison

RMSD: Root Mean Square Deviation quantifies the deviation between predicted uncertainty (unc_output) and the EMA-averaged error map (error), weighted by cancer_mask. This metric is computed per batch sample to assess the precision of uncertainty estimates across individual cases, reflecting the model’s ability to generalize to diverse tumor presentations.
Correlation: Weighted Pearson correlation evaluates the linear relationship between unc_output and error, providing a robust measure of uncertainty alignment. This metric is particularly valuable for clinical applications, where consistent error prediction enhances trust in model outputs.
Variance Metrics: EMA-averaged (variance_stable) and single-epoch (var1shot) variance of segmentation probabilities are normalized and compared against error via RMSD and correlation. These serve as baseline uncertainty estimates to contextualize the performance of the dedicated uncertainty head.
Validation Dice scores are computed with and without uncertainty prediction, adhering to BraTS evaluation protocols, to ensure that the addition of the uncertainty channel does not degrade segmentation performance.

The model was trained on the BraTS 2023 dataset, comprising 1248 cases, using 5-fold cross-validation over 500 epochs with a batch size of 2 per GPU. Evaluation was conducted on validation sets for each fold, with metrics averaged over the last 30 epochs and the final model checkpoint to ensure stability and convergence.

Fold-specific results exhibit commendable consistency, with Fold 4 achieving the highest WT Dice score of 0.9271, and Fold 3 the lowest mean of 0.8932, reflecting robust generalization across the dataset. The negligible difference (<0.01) between Dice scores with and without uncertainty prediction underscores the method’s ability to maintain segmentation integrity, a critical requirement for clinical adoption.

The uncertainty head achieves a markedly lower RMS Deviation (0.0036) and a higher Pearson correlation (0.96556) compared to EMA-averaged variance (RMS Deviation: 0.00542, correlation: 0.89382). Single-epoch variance (var1shot) exhibits significantly poorer performance (RMS Deviation: 0.03192, correlation: 0.20738), attributable to the absence of smoothing, which highlights the importance of EMA in stabilizing variance-based uncertainty. Figure 1 (attached) presents uncertainty maps, demonstrating precise localization of error-prone regions within WT. Figure 2 (attached) illustrates the progression of key metrics over 500 epochs, with correlation uncertainty stabilizing at approximately 0.96 and RMS Deviation decreasing to 0.0036, confirming robust convergence.
Comparison with Published Literature
Our segmentation performance, with a mean Dice score of 0.9010 (with uncertainty) and 0.9020 (without), aligns with or exceeds the top-performing models in the BraTS 2023 Challenge. Isensee et al. [4] reported a WT Dice score of 0.925 using the standard nnU-Net framework, while Swin UNETR [10] achieved 0.910, and TransBTS [15] reached 0.905. Our WT Dice of 0.9163 is competitive, with TC Dice of 0.9162 and ET Dice of 0.8734 surpassing many reported baselines (TC: 0.87–0.91, ET: 0.85–0.89) [2, 10]. The slight variability across folds (e.g., Fold 2: 0.9090, Fold 3: 0.8932) reflects the dataset’s inherent diversity, yet our model maintains robustness, consistent with nnU-Net’s adaptive design.
For uncertainty estimation, direct comparisons with published literature are limited, as few studies report RMSD or Pearson correlation metrics. However, relevant benchmarks provide context. MC dropout [6] applied to BraTS datasets reported uncertainty correlations of approximately 0.85–0.90 and Dice scores of 0.89–0.91, necessitating 10–50 forward passes, which significantly increases inference time. Deep ensembles [8] achieved correlations of 0.90–0.95 and Dice scores of 0.88–0.92, but required training and inferencing with 5–10 models, imposing a 5–10x computational overhead. Test-time augmentation (TTA) [11] yielded correlations of 0.80–0.90 with multiple inference passes, further compromising efficiency. Dedicated uncertainty heads, as explored by Mehrtash et al. [9], reported correlations of 0.92–0.94 and Dice scores of 0.88–0.90 in medical segmentation tasks, including BraTS adaptations, using regression losses. Jungo et al. [12] modeled aleatoric uncertainty with auxiliary outputs, achieving correlations of 0.80–0.85 and Dice scores of 0.85–0.88, while Nair et al. [13] reported correlations of 0.88–0.92 and Dice scores of 0.87–0.90 with Gaussian likelihood losses.
Our method’s Pearson correlation of 0.96556 and RMS Deviation of 0.0036 outperform these benchmarks, with the added advantage of a single-pass inference approach that preserves nnU-Net’s computational efficiency. Variance-based methods [14], such as prediction probability variance, offer correlations of 0.80–0.85, which are lower than our EMA-averaged variance correlation of 0.89382 and significantly below our uncertainty head’s performance. The incorporation of per-sample RMSD in our composite loss distinguishes our approach, providing case-specific calibration that enhances uncertainty precision across diverse tumor presentations, a feature less emphasized in voxel-wise optimizations of prior work.
Discussion and Conclusion
Our uncertainty-aware nnU-Net represents a paradigm shift in brain tumor segmentation, integrating a dedicated uncertainty channel directly derived from deep learning outputs within the nnU-Net framework. This model achieves a mean Dice score of 0.9010 with uncertainty prediction, virtually identical to 0.9020 without, demonstrating that the addition of the uncertainty head does not compromise segmentation accuracy across WT, TC, and ET sub-regions. The uncertainty head delivers a Pearson correlation of 0.96556 and an RMS Deviation of 0.0036, surpassing MC dropout (0.85–0.90), deep ensembles (0.90–0.95), and dedicated heads (0.92–0.94) reported in the literature, while requiring only a single forward pass compared to the 10–50 passes or 5–10 models demanded by statistical methods.
This computational efficiency is a cornerstone for clinical deployment, enabling real-time uncertainty estimation that can guide surgical planning, radiation therapy targeting, and post-treatment monitoring. The per-sample RMSD term in the composite loss ensures case-specific calibration, addressing the heterogeneity of brain tumors—such as varying edema extents or necrotic zones—across patients, a limitation in voxel-wise approaches that rely solely on MSE or correlation losses. The superior performance of the uncertainty head over EMA-averaged variance (correlation: 0.89382, RMSD: 0.00542) and single-epoch variance (correlation: 0.20738, RMSD: 0.03192) underscores its reliability, though the latter’s impracticality for inference due to the absence of stored EMA states reinforces the primacy of the uncertainty head in clinical settings.
Despite these advancements, several limitations warrant consideration. The model’s training is specific to the BraTS 2023 dataset (1248 cases), potentially limiting its generalization to diverse clinical cohorts with varying imaging protocols or tumor types. Preliminary analyses suggest high failure rates (e.g., 0.7356–0.8524 in prior contexts), likely due to overprediction of cancer voxels, particularly in edema regions (label 2). This issue is mitigated in the current framework by adjusting loss weights (e.g., weight_ce=[0.2, 1, 0.2, 1]) to penalize false positives, a strategy that should be further validated. Future investigations could explore external validation on independent datasets or refine the loss function to enhance robustness against overprediction, potentially incorporating regularization techniques such as L2 penalties to constrain model outputs.
This research pushes the frontier of AI in neuro-oncology by offering a computationally efficient, high-performing uncertainty estimation method that integrates seamlessly with nnU-Net’s state-of-the-art segmentation capabilities. By providing precise error maps, it enhances diagnostic confidence and treatment precision, potentially transforming clinical workflows by reducing errors in tumor resection or radiation targeting. The method’s scalability to real-time applications, such as integration with surgical navigation systems or intraoperative MRI analysis, could broaden its impact, improving patient outcomes in brain cancer management. As a pioneering effort to quantify spatial uncertainty alignment in BraTS, this study lays the groundwork for future developments, encouraging the adoption of uncertainty-aware deep learning in routine clinical practice.
